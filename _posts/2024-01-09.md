# Introduction

Both on Arch and Debian-based distributions I've encountered j8/j12 error while trying to install any version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager (RVM). Even though solutions were accessible for Mac OS, I couldn't find any solutions for my system. Unexpectedly, it appears that resolving this error is just a matter of a few command lines.

# Fix

In order to fix j8/j12 error, we will have to install Ruby with OpenSSL support.

## OpenSSL Installation
  ```bash
  $ rvm pkg install openssl
  ```

## Locate the OpenSSL Installation Directory
  OpenSSL is typically installed within RVM's usr directory. To find the RVM installation directory, execute the following command:
  ```bash
  $ which rvm
  ```
  <div>

  </div>

The output indicates that the RVM executable is located at `/usr/share/rvm/bin/rvm`, signifying that the primary RVM directory is `/usr/share/rvm`.  Consequently, the location of OpenSSL within RVM is `/usr/share/rvm/usr`.


## Ruby Installation with OpenSSL flag
  Now, let's utilize the OpenSSL location obtained from the previous step. For this example, let's install version 2.6.5. We'll use the --with-openssl-dir=/path/to/openssl/ flag to specify the path to the installed OpenSSL package.
  ```bash
  $ rvm install 2.6.5 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/share/rvm/usr
  ```
  <div align="center">

  </div>
  And that's it! Ruby 2.6.5 is installed ‚ù§
