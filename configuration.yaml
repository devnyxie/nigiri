  I'm Tim, a multilingual individual fluent in Russian, Greek, English, and Polish. Although currently residing in Poland, I've spent the majority of my life in Greece. As a digital craftsman, both my work and hobby revolve around creating and continuous learning. Finding solace in this lifestyle, I have a penchant for romanticizing programming.
